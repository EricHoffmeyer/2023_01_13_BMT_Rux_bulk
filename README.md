# 2023_01_13_BMT_Rux_bulk

This repository contains the analysis of a bulk RNAseq dataset generated in January 2023.

Briefly, mice were given bone marrow transplants ("BMT") with the following conditions:
- Balb/c bone marrow into C57BL/6 (aka black 6 or B6) irradaited with 6.5Gy (rejection condition)
- Balb/c bone marrow into Balb/c mice with ~10Gy irradiation (autologous acceptance, Balb/c)
- B6 bone marrow into B6 mice with 13Gy irradiation (autologous acceptance, B6)
- Balb/c bone marrow into B6 mice, 6.5Gy irradiation, + Ruxolitinib treatment (allogenic acceptance/mixed chimerism)

Mice were irradiated at Day -1 and the BMT was performed at Day 0. Ruxolitinib treatment was given from Day -5 to Day +28. Mice were sacked at D35.

Additional data for control CD4 and CD8 T cells (isolated from spleens) was brought in from GEO to use as another control.
